// PURPOSE:  The game of TicTacToe is a popular game which consists of
//           alternating between two players, X's and O's, where the players
//           are trying to get 3 of their pieces in a row on the board. The
//           board consists of a 3 by 3 area and if there is no winner then
//           the game results in a tie.
// INPUT:    reads in integer values input from user to place where they want
//           their player piece to go on the board
// PROCESS:  The user will be prompted by a welcome message. Once they have
//           chosen to play, they will be prompted with a blank board and
//           will be asked to input two numbers individually for a spot on
//           board to place the user piece. They will alternate turns, and the
//           program will check after each turn to see if there is a winner.
//           If there is a winner, the statistics will be updated and the
//           program will display the board one last time. Then the statistics
//           will be printed to the screen and the user will be asked to play
//           again. If the user wants to play again, the program will repeat
//           as long as the user wants to play.
// OUTPUT:   User will be welcomed with a welcome message and then each player
//           will be prompted to input integer values to input their player
//           character on the board and will switch off turns. Once someone
//           has gotten 3 in a row somewhere on the board, or once the board
//           has been filled with characters and there is no winner, the game
//           will display a game won message or game tie message. The program
//           will then print the board to the screen again for one last time
//           and then then program will display the statistics of wins and
//           ties and will ask the user if they want to keep playing. If they
//           continue to play, the program will repeat.
